Pix2Pix: Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Adversarial Networks

Pix2Pix is a powerful image-to-image translation framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It enables the transformation of input images from one domain to another, achieving tasks such as colorization, style transfer, and more. This repository houses the implementation of Pix2Pix, providing a flexible and easy-to-use architecture for developers and researchers interested in image translation tasks.

Key Features:

Conditional GANs: Pix2Pix utilizes conditional GANs, where the generator is conditioned on input images to produce realistic output images in the target domain.
U-Net Architecture: The generator adopts a U-Net architecture, facilitating the preservation of fine details during the translation process.
Adversarial Loss: The model is trained with adversarial loss, ensuring that the generated images are indistinguishable from real images in the target domain.
L1 Loss: To further enhance the visual quality of the generated images, a pixel-wise L1 loss is employed to encourage similarity between the generated and ground truth images.
Training Options: The repository provides customizable training options, including hyperparameters, learning rate schedules, and data augmentation techniques.
